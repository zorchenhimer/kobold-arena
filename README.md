# KOBOLd Arena

This was a short project that was mostly written on stream in COBOL because I
thought it would be funny.

The game is simply an arena gauntlet.  You versus endless monsters.  You choose
your stats at the start and fight monsters until you die.

## Building

Install GNUCobol (cobc) and GNU Make and run `make` in the game's source
directory.  If you are on windows, open up the game's source folder in the
command line and run the `set_env.bat` file from the GNUCobol folder that you
installed before running `make`.
